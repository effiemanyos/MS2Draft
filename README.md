## **User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project 1**

### **Project Overview**

This project consists of a **static front-end website** built to help **Entrepreneurs, Tech Startups, Small Businesses, Non-Profits, Entry-Level Professionals, Recent Graduates, Professional Expats** achieve their professional goals by providing them with the right tools. From a business perspective, this project is to **build a strategic professional online presence for the owner, promote and sell her services and online courses, build a community around the fields of interest, become an Irish thought leader, and build a solid personal branding resulting in a profitable business**. 

This project is the first milestone in obtaining a **[Full-Stack Web Development](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/) University-Rated Professional Diploma** from **[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)**. Only **HTML** and **CSS** were required for this project (**Bootstrap** was optional); however, other technologies were slightly used to improve the overall quality and user experience.

## **Structure Plane** 
____

### **Website Structure**

At the moment, the website consists in only **1 page containing 11 sections**, one after the other. The **current structure** of the website is the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|TESTIMONIALS|CONTACT|
|--|----|-----|---|---|---|
|Hero Image|About Me|How Can I Help|~~Learning Hub~~|Testimonials|Contact Me|
||Work Experience|What I Do|Communities|||
||Qualifications|||||

> Besides the 'Navigation' and 'Footer' section, which goes on top and after the 'Contact Me' section, respectively.

### **Planned Structure**

The **intended structure** of the website for the **MVP** was the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|RESOURCES|JOIN US|CONTACT|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Hero Image |About Me|How Can I Help (*)|~~Learning Hub~~|Recommend Resources (^)|~~Memberships~~|Contact Me|
|About Me|~~Expertise~~|What I Do (**)|~~Workshops & Webinars~~|~~Books & eBooks~~|~~Join Huasi~~|Footer|
|How Can I Help (*)|Work Experience|Digital Marketing|~~Online Courses~~|~~Blogs & Newsletters~~|~~Join NetCork~~||

|Contact Me|Contact Me|Contact Me|~~Virtual Meetups~~|~~Other Resources~~||
|Footer|Footer|Footer|Footer|Footer||

>(*) Services types  
(**) Services fields  
(^) Summary of all the recommended types of resources 

Unfortunately, the **scope** had to be reduced and adjusted due to a lack of resources, which the most vital was **time**, and then **knowledge** to develop some sections and complex features.

### **Future Additions**

The sections that will be added in the near future are the following:

|HOME|ABOUT|SERVICES|TRAINING|RESOURCES|JOIN US|CONTACT|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Welcome Video (#)|Side Projects|Entrepreneurship|Workshops & Webinars|Books & eBooks|Memberships|Book a Call (**)|
|Featured In (*)|Volunteering|Recommended Partners|Online Courses|Blogs & Newsletters|Join Huasi||
|Key Figures||Case Studies (Clients)|1:1 & Group Sessions|Podcasts & Clubhouse|Join NetCork||
|Instagram Feed|||Podcast & YouTube|PPL/SM/YT Channels|P&C||
|Clients|||Blog & Newsletter|Free/Cheap Tools||
||||Virtual Meetups|Other Resources (^)||

> (#) Welcome Video or Hero Video   
(*) 'Featured In' or 'Partners' section  
(**) [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) integration so that users can **book free consultations** without having to send an email or a message.     
(^) Communities, White Papers, Toolkits, Guides, Templates, Frameworks, Networking, Volunteering, Cheat Sheets, Infographics, Events, etc.    

Besides these sections, a **login/logout** feature will be implemented in the navigation bar so that users can access exclusive content provided to their chosen membership plan.    

This will also require the implementation of a feature that allows users to make **payments online** for their prefered subscription plan on a monthly or annually basis.

## **Surface Plane** 
____

### **Typography**

Only two fonts were used for this project.

- **[Neucha](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Neucha?query=Neucha&preview.text_type=custom)**, designed by Jovanny Lemonad, for all titles and subtitles.  
- **[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins&preview.text_type=custom)**, designed by Indian Type Foundry, Jonny Pinhorn, for all paragraphs.

**Font Styling:**

The following styling has been used for consistency and alignment throughout the entire website:
- **Titles (h1, h2):** 

```CSS
/* Main Titles Styling */
.titles {
    font-family: Neucha, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 40px;
    letter-spacing: 4px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    text-align: center;
}
```

- **Subtitles (h3, h4):**

```CSS
/* Subtitles Styling */
.subtitles {
    font-family: Neucha, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 25px;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
}
```

- **Paragraphs (p):**

```CSS
/* Paragraphs Styling */
.paragraphs {
    font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

- **CTA Buttons Text:**

```CSS
/* CTA Buttons Text Styling */
.cta-buttons {
    font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 12px;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
    font-weight: 600;
}
```

### **Color Scheme**

According to an article on **[The Science of Colour Persuasion](https://idealogicbrandlab.com/color-persuasion/)** by **IDealogic® Brand Lab**:

Colour establishes **brand recognition** amongst consumers, therefore it is crucial that the same colours are always used across all channels, such as website, social media, advertising, product packaging, merchandising, etc.

The following are the colours used for this project:

![the website and brand colour palette](./assets/images/color-scheme.png "the website and brand colour palette")

**Primary Colours:**
> - **Purple** → Associated with **wisdom, wealth, spirituality, imaginative, and sophistication**.
> - **Black** → Associated with **sophistication, luxury, security, power, elegance, authority, and substance**.
> - **Green** → Associated with **health, tranquility, growth, freshness, prosperity, hope, balance, harmony, and nature**.
> - **Pink** → Associated with femininity. **Imaginative, passionate, caring, creativity, innovative, quirky**. 

At the end, only these colours were used throughout the entire website (MVP stage): 

![the mvp color scheme](./assets/images/color-scheme-mvp.png "the mvp color scheme")

### **Imagery**

Illustrations were taken from **[UnDraw](https://undraw.co/)** to improve the UX. These illustrations have been modified to match the website and brand colours.

Professional photographies from **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)** have been used for the Hero Image, Work Experience and Testimonials section of the website. 

When ready, professional photos and videos will be added to the website in various sections. Some of the images and videos will come from:
- Workshops
- Events
- Webinars
- Collaborations
- Volunteering
- Owner's Promotional Photos

At the moment, the imagery used is for academic purposes only in order to meet the project deadline. These images will be replaced before the launch of the website.
